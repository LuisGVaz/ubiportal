# Prerequisites #

This chapter will provide instructions targeting Linux-based operating systems and assume you have familiarity with command-line tooling. 

At the moment, support for Windows in the Backstage tooling is limited, but some users have found Visual Studio Dev Containers useful for a smoother experience, especially around running PostgreSQL. 

Youâ€™ll need to have installed:

Node Version 16 (It is recommended to use volta or nvm to manage node versions)
Yarn to manage dependencies
Git for source control
