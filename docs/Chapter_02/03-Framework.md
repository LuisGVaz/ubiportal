# Backstage is a Framework #

Backstage is not a finished product that you can install and use. Rather, Backstage is a collection of tools and libraries that can be used to create your own Developer Portal. This is great because you can adapt Backstage to work for your organization, no matter what setup you have.

Backstage’s core is composed of around 25 packages, which include a CLI, utility tools, API definitions, themes, and helpers. But what really makes up Backstage are the more than 150 open source plugin packages available, which include the framework’s main features. You can pick and choose what you need and extend its functionality by creating new plugins too.

But don’t worry, you don’t have to learn what all those packages are to get started. Backstage provides you with a starting point through their CLI, and from there, you can add or remove plugins as you please.
