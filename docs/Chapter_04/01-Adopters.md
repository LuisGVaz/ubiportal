Although it is a relatively new project, over a hundred organizations have chosen Backstage to build their Developer Portal. Setting up Backstage requires time commitment before it can be helpful, but it pays off, as enterprise and scale-up reports in several case studies. 

Enterprise teams as large as HP, American Airlines, or Expedia Group have brought thousands of developers to their Backstage instances to help navigate their complex ecosystems. They have heavily customized Developer Portals optimized for their needs and brand and shared that executive buy-in was crucial for their adoption.

Dozens of scale-up have also joined the backstage community, including Netlify, Snyk, and Glovo. They often use Backstage to manage their rapid growth because it allows them to easily onboard new engineers. They see developer experience as a core value and Backstage as an essential enabler for their teams.

Looking at the Backstage public adopters’ list, you’ll see a wide range of organizations from different industries and sizes.
