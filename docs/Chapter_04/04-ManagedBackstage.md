# Managed Backstage #

As with other open source projects, there is a commercial offering for managed and hosted Backstage by Roadie.io, an official Backstage partner. Most adopters who have gone down this road are scale-ups who do not want to own the platform’s maintenance burden and don’t need heavy customizations.

The advantage of managed Backstage is that you get a production instance and need no knowledge of React or Node. You set up all integrations and plugins through a UI and get all updates automatically. Effectively, this translates into needing fewer people to maintain your Developer Portal.

The disadvantage of managed Backstage is that you have less flexibility about what you can do with Backstage.
