# Technology Stack #

The technology stack might be an important consideration when deciding whether you choose Backstage to build your developer portal. As an aggregator, Backstage brings together different technologies, but they’re all quite popular. 

To work on your Backstage instance, you’ll be working with a lot of YAML, as YAML files are the primary source of metadata. For a basic setup, you’ll find it handy to have some knowledge of React to update your instance’s UI to include plugins. If you need custom processors or plugins, you’ll need a good understanding of Node, as it’s what powers Backstage’s backend. TypeScript is favored across the project.

For local development, you can benefit from knowing how to use Docker. It will allow you to run a Backstage instance more efficiently or to build TechDocs before you deploy them, for example. Backstage uses YARN for package management. 

To follow up with the framework better, it’ll be handy for you to understand how monorepos work, as Backstage is implemented as such. Backstage follows a Semantic Versioning schema, cutting minor versions once a month.
